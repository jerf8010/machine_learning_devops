`pylint script_name.py` will provide feedback on updates to make to your code, as well as a score out of 10 that can help you understand which improvements are most important.
`pip install pylint`

* `autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive script_name.py` will attempt to automatically clean up your code.
`pip install autopep8`
